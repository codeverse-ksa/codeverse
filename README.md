## Adding a Program

Here are the steps to add a program to the application:

- Pull the latest version of the GitHub repository with the following command `git pull`
- Open up a command line interface and run `npm run dev`, which will run the website on `localhost:3000`
- Open the Prisma GUI using another command line interface using `npx prisma studio`, opening the GUI on `localhost:5555`
- Go to the `Program` table, add a record using `Add Record` and fill out the details and save the record
- To add an image, add the image in the `/images` directory in the `/public` directory.
- Refresh the website and ensure the program is added on the `/programs` page
